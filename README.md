### Welcome To Hangman

To play, start by choosing your TV show theme, there are 6 to choose from:

#### 1. How I Met Your Mother
#### 2. Big Mouth
#### 3. Friends
#### 4. Game of Thrones
#### 5. This is Us
#### 6. The Office

The blank letters representing the word will show up at the bottom. Using the theme and the amount of 'letters' shown, you can start guessing!

To guess, choose letters from the left-side keyboard until you guess the correct word. But choose wisely, you only have 10 guesses!
